      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water">Clean water</a> is an essential factor for organisms to survive. Water consists of approximately 60% of our body, acting as a universal solvent to execute chemical reactions and dissolve nutrients, a fluid that regulates bodily temperature and acidity, transports nutrients, excrete wastes, lubricates mucous membranes, and cushion our internal organs. Dehydration or consumption of unfiltered water may lead to contamination and malfunction of vital organs, leading to illnesses such as; cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, polio, and even death. <b>Our projectâ€™s most foremost criteria is to identify what material can filter this fluid the best.</b></p>
    </section>
  
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p><u>Charcoal</u> is the best material to filter/purify dirty water.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Analysis & Evaluation of our Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>After executing the experiment regarding water filtration of natural materials, the best material to filter water was Charcoal with a Turbidity of 23.33,  Electrical Conductivity with 30.6, and a pH level of 7.6. While the other aspects show great filtration efficiency, the pH levels are significantly high, even compared to the other substances. With this, we can infer that this is influenced by the charcoal, having an alkaline(pH levels higher than 7) nature, its acidity varying from pH 8~9, that microbe particles of the following charcoal layer of filter dissolved into the aqueous, passed through the layer of cotton balls, and resultantly increased the pH level of the water.
      <br>
      Regarding the results, we can show our hypothesis proved <b>true</b>. It is easily intelligible that except the pH levels, the graphs are showing a <u>positive linear trend to the size of particles</u>, from small(charcoal) to big(pebbles). By this as small particles are shown to be much more efficient at differentiating the dirt solution with water, eliciting support from the following parameters.</p>
