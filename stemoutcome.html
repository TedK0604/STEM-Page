      <h2>Result Analysis</h2>
      <img src="table.png" alt="Results Table"><br>
      Activated Carbon clearly performed the best, showing the lowest electrical conductivity (30.6 µS/cm) and TDS (23.33 mg/L), which means it removed the most dissolved ions from the water. This strong performance is likely due to its highly porous surface and large surface area, which helps it adsorb a wide range of impurities. Its pH average of 7.60 stayed close to neutral, meaning it didn’t alter the water's acidity, making it a reliable option for filtration.
      <br><br>
      Fine Sand and Coarse Sand did moderately well, with Fine Sand showing slightly better results in conductivity and TDS than Coarse Sand. These materials likely filter by trapping particles through small gaps between grains rather than chemically binding them, which explains their higher average values compared to Activated Carbon. Both sands maintained a stable pH, suggesting they don’t negatively affect the water’s acid-base balance, which is a positive trait for general filtration use.
      <br><br>
      On the other hand, Dirt Balls and Pebbles showed the weakest filtration performance, especially Pebbles, which had the highest TDS (110 mg/L) and a fairly high conductivity. These materials likely lack the fine structure or chemical properties needed to effectively trap or adsorb dissolved solids. Their lower performance could also be due to larger particle sizes, which allow more ions to pass through, making them less suitable for serious filtration.

      <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>The water filtration experiment tested five materials: activated carbon, fine sand, coarse sand, dirt balls, and pebbles. Activated carbon was the most effective, showing the lowest electrical conductivity (30.6 µS/cm) and ppm (23.33), with a stable, neutral pH of 7.60. This indicates it removed the most impurities while maintaining water quality.
        Fine sand also performed well, with moderate reductions in conductivity and ppm, and a pH of 7.59. It’s a solid natural filter, though less effective than activated carbon. Dirt balls gave average results—better than coarse sand and pebbles—suggesting they can trap some impurities, though not consistently.
        Coarse sand and pebbles showed the weakest performance. Coarse sand had the highest conductivity and an alkaline pH, indicating poor filtration and possible mineral leaching. Pebbles barely filtered the water, with the highest ppm (110) and minimal impact on pH.
        Overall, finer and more porous materials like activated carbon and fine sand were best at cleaning water, while larger, less absorbent materials like pebbles were least effective.</p>
