    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>
      The water filtration experiment tested five materials: activated carbon, fine sand, coarse sand, dirt balls, and pebbles. Activated carbon was the most effective, showing the lowest electrical conductivity (30.6 µS/cm) and ppm (23.33), with a stable, neutral pH of 7.60. This indicates it removed the most impurities while maintaining water quality.<br><br>
      Fine sand also performed well, with moderate reductions in conductivity and ppm, and a pH of 7.59. It’s a solid natural filter, though less effective than activated carbon. Dirt balls gave average results—better than coarse sand and pebbles—suggesting they can trap some impurities, though not consistently.<br><br>
      Coarse sand and pebbles showed the weakest performance. Coarse sand had the highest conductivity and an alkaline pH, indicating poor filtration and possible mineral leaching. Pebbles barely filtered the water, with the highest ppm (110) and minimal impact on pH.<br><br>
      Overall, finer and more porous materials like activated carbon and fine sand were best at cleaning water, while larger, less absorbent materials like pebbles were least effective.
